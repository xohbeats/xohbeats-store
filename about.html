      <h2>About XoH! Beats</h2>
      <p>
        XoH! Beats is a creative force driven by emotion, storytelling, and innovation. Inspired by the energy of Juice WRLD and the depth of J. Cole, this sound is made for artists who want to connect on a soul level.
      </p>
      <p>
        From melodic trap loops to cinematic rage drops, XoH! Beats delivers genre-bending instrumentals that blend pain and poetry, rhythm and reflection. It's not just production — it's a movement.
      </p>
      <p>
        The XoH! brand expands beyond music into ebooks, fashion, and visual content through the XOLLENT sub-brand — fusing skulls, space, and abstract vibes into the lifestyle.
